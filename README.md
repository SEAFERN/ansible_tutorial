# How to deploy Rails Applications With Ansible, Capistrano, and Semaphore

This is the code for the [tutorial](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-rails-applications-with-ansible-capistrano-and-semaphore)
I wrote on deploying Rails applications with Ansible, Capistrano, and Semaphore
that is published on the Semaphore website.

Some of the versions might be different in this repository compared to what is
in the tutorial due to security problems forcing an update. Nothing has been
tested on these versions, only the versions listed in the tutorial itself.

This code is not maintained. There will eventually be out of date dependencies.
I recommend updating them if needed to avoid security problems.
